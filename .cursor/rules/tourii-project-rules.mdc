# 4 Step before every prompt

1. System Design Mode

“Before coding, outline the full implementation strategy. Include architecture, logic flow, edge cases, and failure handling. Don’t write code yet.”

Expected Result:
```
This gives you:

– Logic breakdown
– Structure planning
– Surface-level bugs before they happen
```

2. Assumption Check

“List all assumptions you’re making about my request. Ask clarifying questions before continuing.”

Expected Result:
```
Now you’re aligning brains; avoids misunderstanding.
```

3. Validation Loop

“What would likely break or be misunderstood in this implementation? Suggest improvements.”

Expected Result:
```
This makes Cursor doing a code review on itself.
```

4. Execution Mode

Once the plan looks right, then say:

“Now write the code according to your plan above. Keep it modular, well-commented, and easy to edit.”
