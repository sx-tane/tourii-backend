# Security Guidelines for Tourii Backend

This document outlines essential security practices that must be followed in the Tourii backend development.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Implementation

- Use secure JWT signing with strong algorithms (RS256)
- Implement token rotation and refresh mechanisms
- Store tokens securely in HTTP-only cookies
- Set appropriate token expiration times

### API Key Management

- Use cryptographically secure random strings
- Include prefix for key type identification
- Set appropriate expiration dates
- Generate unique key pairs for different environments

### Role-Based Access Control

- Implement role-based guards in NestJS
- Define clear role hierarchies
- Use decorators for route protection
- Regular audit of role assignments

### Multi-Provider Authentication

- Secure OAuth2 implementation for Discord, Twitter, Google
- Proper state management in OAuth flow
- Secure storage of provider tokens
- Regular token validation

## 2. Database Security

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

- Enable RLS on all PostgreSQL tables
- Implement policies using Prisma middleware
- Regular review of RLS policies
- Document all access patterns

### Data Encryption

- Encrypt sensitive user data at rest
- Use strong encryption algorithms
- Secure key management
- Regular key rotation

### Input Validation

- Validate all inputs using class-validator
- Implement custom validation pipes
- Sanitize user inputs
- Regular security audits

## 3. API Security

### Rate Limiting

- Implement rate limiting using NestJS middleware
- Configure limits based on endpoint usage
- Monitor and adjust limits as needed
- Log suspicious activity

### Request Validation

- Use DTOs for all API endpoints
- Implement request transformation pipes
- Validate request headers
- Sanitize request bodies

### CORS Configuration

- Configure CORS policies in NestJS
- Restrict allowed origins
- Set appropriate headers
- Regular policy review

### API Key Usage Guidelines

1. **Key Generation**

   - Use cryptographically secure random strings
   - Include prefix for key type identification
   - Set appropriate expiration dates
   - Generate unique key pairs for different environments

2. **Key Storage**

   - Never store API keys in code or version control
   - Use secure key management service
   - Encrypt keys at rest
   - Implement key rotation policies

3. **Key Distribution**

   - Distribute keys through secure channels
   - Provide key management dashboard
   - Allow key revocation
   - Implement key usage monitoring

4. **Key Usage**
   - Require keys for all API endpoints
   - Implement different permission levels
   - Monitor key usage patterns
   - Alert on suspicious activity

## 4. Blockchain Security

### Key Management

- Secure storage of blockchain keys
- Use hardware security modules (HSM)
- Implement key rotation
- Regular key audits

### Transaction Security

- Validate all blockchain transactions
- Implement transaction signing
- Monitor gas usage
- Handle failed transactions

### Smart Contract Security

- Regular contract audits
- Implement upgrade patterns
- Monitor contract events
- Handle contract errors

## 5. Error Handling

### Error Responses

- Standardize error responses
- Implement global exception filters
- Log errors appropriately
- Mask sensitive information

### Logging

- Implement structured logging
- Include request context
- Log security events
- Regular log analysis

## 6. Monitoring & Alerts

### System Monitoring

- Monitor API endpoints
- Track error rates
- Monitor blockchain interactions
- Set up alerts for anomalies

### Security Monitoring

- Monitor failed login attempts
- Track suspicious activities
- Monitor blockchain transactions
- Regular security reports

## 7. Dependencies Management

### Package Security

- Regular dependency updates
- Use package-lock.json
- Audit dependencies
- Document critical dependencies

### Version Control

- Regular security patches
- Document security updates
- Test updates before deployment
- Maintain update schedule

## 8. Deployment Security

### Environment Configuration

- Secure environment variables
- Use different keys per environment
- Regular key rotation
- Document configuration

### Infrastructure Security

- Secure server configuration
- Regular security updates
- Network security
- Access control

## Regular Security Reviews

Schedule regular security reviews to:

1. Audit all security measures
2. Update policies as needed
3. Review logs and incidents
4. Update security documentation

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. Do not disclose it publicly
2. Email security@tourii.com immediately
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Wait for confirmation before any disclosure
